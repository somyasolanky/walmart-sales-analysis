# Walmart Data Analysis: End-to-End SQL + Python Project
## Project Overview


### Install Required Libraries and Load Data
Libraries: Install necessary Python libraries 
Loading Data: Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis and transformations.
### Explore the Data
Goal: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
Analysis: Use functions like .info(), .describe(), and .head() to get a quick overview of the data structure and statistics.
### Data Cleaning
Remove Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
Handle Missing Values: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
Fix Data Types: Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as datetime, prices as float).
Currency Formatting: Use .replace() to handle and format currency values for analysis.
Validation: Check for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.

### SQL Analysis: Complex Queries and Business Problem Solving
Revenue trends across branches and categories.
Identifying best-selling product categories.
Sales performance by time, city, and payment method.
Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.
Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
Documentation: Keep clear notes of each query's objective, approach, and results.

### Requirements
Python 3.8+
SQL Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL
Python Libraries:
pandas, numpy, sqlalchemy, mysql-connector-python, psycopg2
Kaggle API Key (for data downloading)

### Results and Insights
This section will include your analysis findings:

Sales Insights: Key categories, branches with highest sales, and preferred payment methods.
Profitability: Insights into the most profitable product categories and locations.
Customer Behavior: Trends in ratings, payment preferences, and peak shopping hours.
### Future Enhancements
Possible extensions to this project:

Integration with a dashboard tool (e.g., Power BI or Tableau) for interactive visualization.
Additional data sources to enhance analysis depth.
Automation of the data pipeline for real-time data ingestion and analysis.
